Molecular docking is the simplest yet one of the most powerful methods of modelling in the medicinal chemistry field. There are many licensed and free academic options there, but most still need a local installation. This is a cloud pipeline based on Autodock Vina (Smina), aiming to provide a totally free tool to those who want to use molecular docking in their projects. 

You don't have to install anything but provide an SDF file that could be from Chemdraw and a protein RCSB four-letter code that could be from PDB bank website.

There are two notebooks,

one is just for a simple docking on the cloud, 

the other is a more complex one integrated with molecular dynamics to address the flexibility of protein pocket, i.e., it is very similar to the conception of so-called induced fit docking. (Actually, it is better than most commercial induced-fit docking algorithms just beause none of those ever do any full atom simulation at all)

Either docking or MD will be all done on cloud.

Adjust the MD time based on how impatient you are. The MD method is partly borrowed from https://github.com/pablo-arantes/Making-it-rain.
