# Free_Cloud_Docking


Molecular docking is the simplest yet one of the most powerful methods of modelling in the medicinal chemistry field. There are many licensed and free academic options there, but most still need a local installation. This is a cloud pipeline based on Autodock Vina (Smina), aiming to provide a totally free tool to those who want to use molecular docking in their projects. You don't have to install anything but provide an SDF file that could be from Chemdraw and a protein RCSB four-letter code.

There are two notebooks, one is just for a simple docking on cloud, the other is a more complex one integrated with molecular dynamic to address the flexibility of protein pocket, i.e., it is very similar to the conception of so called induced fit docking. (Acturally it is better than most commercial induced fit docking algorithums just beause none of those ever do any full atom simulation at all)
